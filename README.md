Hate speech and online violence are rampant nowadays, SAF3BOOK mean to make social media a safe place for everyone!

# Inspiration
As we are facing 2019 General election in our country Nigeria, one of the most mitigating factors against the peaceful co-existence of the nation of different tribes and multiple religions and aggravate our democratic governance in Nigeria is hate speech and online violence. 

Hate speech and online violence result in many numbers of crises in Nigeria that claims thousands of lives and properties worth billions of dollars across its regions. Different attempts have been made by Government and nongovernmental organizations to mitigate if not eliminate the act among its citizens hence the Nigerian Government passed a bill that makes hate speech as an act of terrorism.

Fortunately, Nigeria is a diverse country that comprises hundreds of tribes and numerous religious thoughts and beliefs these factors results in natural disharmony among the citizens, when someone said something according to his belief and thoughts others might feel offended.

Our research is aim to help and promote nonuse of any form of hate speech in social media and to assist social media users on what to write and what to read that will not offend them or others. Also to provide analytic data to security concerns on hate speech and online violence.
